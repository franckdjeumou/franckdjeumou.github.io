Before my graduate studies in Austin, I received my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s and Master\u0026rsquo;s degrees in Aerospace Engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO, France, in 2018.

My research lies broadly at the intersection of learning with prior knowledge, control theory, formal methods, and optimization. My research particularly aims to build learning systems that can be explained in human terms, formally verified, and can operate under a scarce amount of data. Specifically, I investigate how prior knowledge on the environment (e.g., known rules, laws of Physics, properties validated from experiments) can be incorporated into learning systems to improve the data efficiency and explainability, and how such knowledge can be used can for the formal verification of the systems, particularly in the context of safety-critical applications such as aircraft control and robotics.\n Download my resumé. -- ","date":1642118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1642713369,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://franckdjeumou.github.io/author/franck-djeumou/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/franck-djeumou/","section":"authors","summary":"Welcome!

Existing methods that employ design-time synthesis of shields do not scale to multi-agent systems. Moreover, such shields are typically implemented in a centralized manner, requiring global information on the state of all agents in the system. We address these limitations through a new approach where the shields are synthesized at runtime and do not require global information. There is a shield onboard every agent, which can only modify the behavior of the corresponding agent. In this approach, which is fundamentally decentralized, the shield on every agent has two components: a pathfinder that corrects the behavior of the agent and an ordering mechanism that dynamically modifies the priority of the agent. The current priority determines if the shield uses the pathfinder to modify behavior of the agent. We derive an upper bound on the maximum deviation for any agent from its original behavior. We prove that the worst-case synthesis time is quadratic in the number of agents at runtime as opposed to exponential at design-time for existing methods. We test the performance of the decentralized, runtime shield synthesis approach on a collision-avoidance problem. For 50 agents in a 50x50 grid, the synthesis at runtime requires a few seconds per agent whenever a potential collision is detected. In contrast, the centralized design-time synthesis of shields for a similar setting is intractable beyond 4 agents in a 5x5 grid.","tags":[],"title":"Online synthesis for runtime enforcement of safety in multi-agent systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franck Djeumou","Abraham P Vinod","Eric Goubault","Sylvie Putot","Ufuk Topcu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1605052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642709953,"objectID":"cc03a4fe46c2a5894583ae64202c49c6","permalink":"https://franckdjeumou.github.io/publication/on-the-fly-control-journal/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T20:19:13.447447Z","relpermalink":"/publication/on-the-fly-control-journal/","section":"publication","summary":"We develop DaTaReach and DaTaControl for the reachability analysis and control of systems with a priori unknown nonlinear dynamics.
